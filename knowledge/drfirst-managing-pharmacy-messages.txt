Action Options for Renewal Requests
------------------------------------------------------------

Forward  
Allows a staff member to forward the prescription request to another qualified prescriber in the practice.

Remove  
Should only be used if the request was previously handled or is a duplicate.

Modify Suggested  
Allows changing prescription details and/or pharmacy information.  
When selected, the prescription becomes a pending prescription in the appropriate provider’s prescription report.  
This alerts the pharmacy that the renewal request was denied, but a new prescription will follow.

Choose a New Drug  
Allows selection of a different medication.  
The prescription becomes a pending prescription in the provider’s prescription report and alerts the pharmacy that the renewal was denied, but a new prescription will follow.

Deny  
Denies the renewal request and sends a denial message to the pharmacy.  
A denial reason must be selected from the dropdown list.

Renew  
Renews the prescription and sends a refill response (REFRES) to the pharmacy.  
The Total Fills Authorized field determines how many fills are approved.  
Example:
- 1 = renewing only
- 2 = renewing plus one additional refill

------------------------------------------------------------
Action Options for Prior Authorizations
------------------------------------------------------------

Approved by Payer  
Approves the medication prescribed by the provider.  
A PRIOR AUTHORIZATION CONFIRMATION NUMBER is required.

Denied by Payer  
Denies the request and sends a denial message to the pharmacy.  
A denial reason must be selected.

Forward  
Forwards the request to another qualified prescriber.

Prior Authorization Not Attempted
