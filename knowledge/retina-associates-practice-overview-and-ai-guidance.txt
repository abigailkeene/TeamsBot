How Work Is Prioritized
===============================

Clinic-First Operations

Patient care always comes first.

System stability during clinic hours is critical.

Non-urgent updates are scheduled outside of patient-facing times.


System Changes and Downtime

Not all systems can be updated immediately.

Many devices require vendor coordination.

Testing is required before changes are made.


Documentation Culture

Processes are documented whenever possible.

EyeHub is the primary location for internal documentation.

Staff are encouraged to check documentation before escalating issues.


===============================
Data Security and Patient Privacy
===============================

Patient data is confidential.

Access is role-based.

Systems follow HIPAA-related requirements.

Staff should never:
- Share passwords
- Store patient data outside approved systems
- Install unauthorized software
- Change system settings without approval


===============================
New Staff and Intern Context
===============================

New staff and interns are expected to:
- Ask questions early
- Follow established procedures
- Use documentation
- Escalate issues when unsure
