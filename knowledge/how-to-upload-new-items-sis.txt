How to Upload New Items (SIS)

Introduction

This guide will walk you through the steps on how to load new items into Envi Inventory that will sync with SIS.

Loading new Inventory Items in Envi is a three-part upload process. It is recommended to complete the following upload types in this order:

1) Inventory – This upload type will populate data found in the Details tab of the item.
2) Inventory Vendor – This upload type will populate data found in the Vendors tab of the item.
3) Inventory Locations – This upload type will populate data found in the Locations tab of the item.


Requirements

User must have Full Access to Inventory and access to Utilities/Load Data.
Please contact your Envi Domain Admin if you require access to these modules.

Inventory data needs to be entered in the Envi Item Master Template Excel file.
Please contact support@envi.com for this template.

To complete all 3 upload types (Inventory, Inventory Vendors, Inventory Locations), the following fields must be entered in the Envi Item Master Template Excel file:

Inventory Group No – default value = 1, please check Org Configurations if you have multiple Inventory Groups.
Inventory No – Internal Inventory Number, must be unique
Inventory Description – Limited to 80 characters
Stock UOM – Lowest UOM, represents On Hand Qty, typically = EA
Classification – SIS requires one of the following:
SUPPLY
MEDICATION
INSTRUMENT
EQUIPMENT
IMPLANT

HCPCS Code – The Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System code for interfacing billing codes in a patient billing system (CPT Code). This field is required by SIS for Billable items.

Facility No – Enter MASTER to upload Master pricing. Enter specific Facility No for Facility Specific pricing.
Vendor No – Internal Vendor Number
Vendor Item No – Vendor’s Product Number
Vendor UOM – Default Purchasing Unit
Manufacturer No – Internal Manufacturer Number. This field is required by SIS.
Manufacturer Item No – Manufacturer’s Product Number. This field is required by SIS.

Sync Flag – Indicates whether an inventory location is synchronized to SIS. Enter True if item should be synchronized to SIS.


Best Practice Tips

Before loading new items into Envi, it is recommended to pull the Inventory Vendors (Extended) and Inventory Locations extracts from the Envi organization and save as backup files. Data uploads in Envi cannot be reversed.

Before uploading Inventory, check to make sure the item does not already exist in Envi. Envi does not automatically identify duplicate or like items.

Item Descriptions must be unique. Duplicate descriptions will cause an error in SIS.

Make sure data only exists in the first tab of the Excel workbook file.

Troubleshooting

Inventory Upload Error Example
Inventory already exists.
Solution: Use a unique Inventory No.

Inventory Vendor Error Example
Vendor record already exists.
Solution: Update Vendor No, Item No, or Vendor UOM.

Inventory Location Error Example
Invalid Item Type.
Solution: Must be Stock, Non-Stock, Consignment, or Service.


UOM Best Practices

Stock UOM represents On Hand Quantity and should be the lowest unit tracked.

Vendor UOM represents the purchasing unit.

Conversion Factor defines how many Stock UOM units exist in a Vendor UOM.

If Vendor CF = 1, Stock UOM must equal Vendor UOM.
If Vendor CF > 1, Stock UOM must not equal Vendor UOM.


Example 1 – Break Down to Each

Vendor sells by Box of 100 Each
Stock UOM = EA
Vendor UOM = BX
Vendor CF = 100

Ordering 2 BX increases on hand by 200 EA.
Location cost equals Vendor Cost divided by 100.


Example 2 – Track Only at Box Level

Vendor sells by Box of 100
Stock UOM = BX
Vendor UOM = BX
Vendor CF = 1

Ordering 2 BX increases on hand by 2 BX.


Alternate Purchasing Units (Inventory Vendor Units)

Alternate purchasing units are additional purchasing units allowed by a vendor.

Example:
BX (25) default
EA (1) alternate


Inventory Vendor Units Required Fields

Inventory Vendor Units Upload Steps

Prepare File
Enter alternate purchasing unit in Vendor UOM 2 fields.

Navigate to Load Data
Upload Type = Inventory Vendor Units

Map Headers
Map Vendor UOM 2 to Vendor UOM.
Map Vendor CF 2 to Vendor CF.

Submit upload.

Confirm Completion.
