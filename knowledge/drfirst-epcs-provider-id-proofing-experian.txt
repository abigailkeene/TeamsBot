DrFirst EPCS - Provider ID Proofing with Experian

------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose
------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this document is to assist providers in completing the Identity Assurance Level (IAL2) identity proofing process required to electronically prescribe controlled and non-controlled medications through DrFirst.

------------------------------------------------------------
Provider Identity Proofing Process (IAL2)
------------------------------------------------------------

Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2) is an identity proofing standard that satisfies Surescripts requirements for e-prescribing.  

For a provider account to be authenticated by the Surescripts standard, each provider must complete an identity proofing (IDP) process. Once completed, the provider’s e-prescribing account may be activated.

------------------------------------------------------------
Step-by-Step Identity Proofing Instructions
------------------------------------------------------------

1. After Nextech initiates an EPCS invite, the provider will receive a system-generated email from:
   infinidadmin@drfirst.com

   Open the email and click the link labeled:
   "Enroll Now"

   This will auto-populate the information on the enrollment screen.

   If the link does not work, a new invitation may be required.

2. The InfinID application will open and display a notification that the organization has requested identity proofing.

   Providers who have previously completed identity proofing may opt to skip this step.

3. Record the temporary session code in case the workflow is interrupted, then select Continue.

4. Complete all mandatory fields:
   - Home address
   - Date of birth (DOB)
   - Mobile phone number
   - Social security number (SSN)

   Recommended field:
   - Credit card number

5. If Experian verifies your information, you will be prompted to scan a QR code using a mobile device.
   If already on a mobile device, select "Tap here" instead.

   Save your temporary session password in case the session times out.

   If Experian does not verify your information, you may be asked credit-related questions before proceeding.

6. Select "Let's Get Started" to consent to identity verification.
   This includes photographing an identification document.

7. Select the type of identification to submit (example: ID card).

8. Allow camera access and select "Capture ID Photo".

9. Take a photo of the front and back of your identification.
   Continue when satisfied with the images.

10. Select "Take Selfie" and take a photograph of yourself.
    Recommended: Take the photo without glasses.

11. You will receive an email confirmation if your identity is successfully verified.
    If unsuccessful, you will be prompted to retry.

    Keep this email for future reference.

------------------------------------------------------------
Authenticator (Token) Setup
------------------------------------------------------------

After identity verification, you must add an authenticator ("token") to your account.

The token generates a one-time PIN (OTP) for two-factor authentication.

Available token options:

- Symantec VIP Access mobile app (soft token)
- Physical hardware token (fob) manufactured by:
  - OneSpan
  - Symantec

Recommended: Register two tokens to avoid being locked out of EPCS access.

If one token is lost and no backup exists, the identity proofing process must be repeated.

------------------------------------------------------------
Passphrase Setup
------------------------------------------------------------

Create a passphrase that will be used for EPCS authentication.

Passphrase requirements:
- 8 to 20 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one number
- No more than two consecutive repeated characters
- Avoid special characters

Create a security question and answer for future account recovery.
These fields are case sensitive.

------------------------------------------------------------
Verification Code
------------------------------------------------------------

A verification code will be sent via:
- SMS text message, or
- Postal mail (approximately 5–7 business days)

Once received, use the original email link from InfinIDAdmin@drfirst.com to enter the verification code.

If the email cannot be located, the administrator must resend the invitation.

------------------------------------------------------------
Final Confirmation
------------------------------------------------------------

After entering the verification code:

1. Enter your passphrase
2. Enter a one-time PIN from your registered token

You will then receive confirmation that identity proofing and EPCS enrollment are complete.

------------------------------------------------------------
Final Step: Logical Access Control (LAC)
------------------------------------------------------------

A clinical administrator must complete Logical Access Control (LAC) to finalize EPCS authorization.

Steps for Clinical Administrator:

1. Log into Nextech
2. Access a test or demo patient
3. Open eRx
4. Click the 3-line menu (top left)
5. Select Utilities
6. Select LAC (Logical Access Control)
7. Select Active next to the provider name
8. Enter administrator name
9. Enter provider NPI and click Authorize
10. Provider selects a token, enters passphrase, and enters one-time passcode

Once complete, the provider is fully authorized to e-prescribe controlled substances (EPCS).
