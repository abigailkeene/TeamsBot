Bereavement Leave

Employees are eligible for up to three days of paid leave in the event of a death in the immediate family.
Additional time off may be taken using accrued PTO.

Immediate family includes spouse, child, parent, sibling, grandparent, grandchild, and in-laws.

Leave for non-family members will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
