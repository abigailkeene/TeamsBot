1. Purpose
Injections are primarily administered to treat various retinal conditions that, if left unmanaged, could lead to vision loss. These injections typically deliver medication directly into the eye, where they can most effectively target issues within the retina. Injections are generally quick and minimally invasive, providing direct treatment to help preserve and, in some cases, improve vision over time. At Retina Associates, our goal with each injection is to support the health and function of patients' eyes and maintain their quality of life.
