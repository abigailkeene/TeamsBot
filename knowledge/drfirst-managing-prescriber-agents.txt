DrFirst - Managing Prescriber Agents

------------------------------------------------------------
What is a Provider Agent?
------------------------------------------------------------

A Provider Agent is an employee authorized to write and send prescriptions on behalf of a licensed prescriber (for example, a technician or scribe).

This allows the technician or scribe to write a prescription on behalf of a licensed prescriber. The pharmacy will fill the prescription and the patient can pick up the prescription without the doctor signing the prescription at that moment.

At a later time, the licensed prescriber MUST sign off on the prescription. This can happen after the prescription has already been filled and picked up by the patient.

------------------------------------------------------------
Exceptions
------------------------------------------------------------

Provider agents:
- Cannot write prescriptions for controlled substances
- Cannot be authorized to send ANY prescriptions in New York
- Cannot be authorized to send ANY prescriptions in Georgia

Granting provider agent privileges establishes an association between the provider and the staff member.

To grant privileges:

1. Locate the staff member
2. Click Authorize next to their name
3. The staff member will move to the Authorized Agent side
4. Check the box affirming the addition
5. Click Approve Changes

The staff member is now authorized to prepare and send prescriptions on behalf of the provider in Rcopia.

------------------------------------------------------------
Provider Notifications
------------------------------------------------------------

Whenever an agent sends a prescription on behalf of a provider in DrFirst, the provider will receive a pending message in their prescription report.

Providers should regularly check these messages and sign off on pending prescriptions.

------------------------------------------------------------
Revoking Provider Agent Privileges
------------------------------------------------------------

To revoke privileges:

1. Follow the same process as authorization
2. Click Revoke Agent instead of Authorize

------------------------------------------------------------
Important Notes
------------------------------------------------------------

Agents can only send prescriptions on behalf of providers who have granted authorization.
