1. Purpose
The purpose of technicians preparing subconj (subconjunctival) products in a sterile
environment before procedures is to ensure that all materials are free from contaminants,
minimizing infection risk and facilitating a smooth, efficient process for the doctor. By
preparing the product in advance under sterile conditions, technicians help create a safe
and ready-to-use setup, allowing the doctor to focus on precise administration, improving
patient outcomes, and maintaining high standards of procedural care.

2. Scope
This SOP outlines the responsibilities and procedures for Clinical Technicians, including
patient preparation, diagnostic testing, assistance during procedures, and equipment
maintenance. It ensures standardized, high-quality support in clinical operations to
enhance patient care and support the medical team in providing effective retina
treatments.

3. Definitions
• Subconj: Subconjunctival

4. Responsibilities
• Clinical Technician: One should be able to consistently perform all assigned
screening duties within the recommended time frame and in accordance with clinic
protocols within 6 months of employment.

5. Subconj

5.1 Tools Needed for Subconj Injection Preparation
1. Sterile Gloves – To maintain a sterile environment and prevent contamination.
2. Mask – For additional infection control to prevent contamination from breath or
droplets.
3. Drapes – Used to cover and isolate the area around the injection site, maintaining a
sterile field.
4. Lidocaine – A local anesthetic to numb the injection site for patient comfort.
5. 30-Gauge ½-Inch Needles (Yellow Box) – For precise administration of the
medication.
6. 1cc Syringe – For drawing and administering the required dosage.
7. Stickers or 2% Stickers – For labeling and tracking purposes, ensuring proper
identification of medication or patient.
8. Door Sign – To indicate that a sterile procedure is in progress, limiting interruptions
and maintaining a sterile environment.

This setup ensures that all necessary tools are on hand for a safe and effective
subconjunctival injection procedure.

5.2 Step by Step Subconj Preparation Procedure

Team Roles:
• Sterile Personnel (2 people) – Responsible for drawing up medication and
attaching needles.
• Non-Sterile Personnel (1-2 people) – Responsible for opening packages and
handling unsterile items.

Preparation:

1. Gather Supplies:
   a. Collect all the necessary materials: sterile gloves, masks, drape, Lidocaine,
      30-gauge needles, 1cc syringes, alcohol wipes, door sign, and stickers.

2. Move to Preparation Room:
   a. All team members go to the designated room to prepare the Lidocaine.

3. Initial Setup:
   a. Place the Door Sign: Attach the sign to the door to indicate a sterile
      preparation is in progress.
   b. Masks: Each team member puts on a mask.
   c. Hand Sanitizer: All team members apply hand sanitizer.

4. Set Up Sterile Field:
   a. Open Drape: Non-sterile personnel open the drape package and place it on
      the desk to create a sterile field.

5. Prepare Non-Sterile Items:
   a. Non-sterile personnel open the syringe plunger package and let the plunger
      fall onto the drape without touching it.
   b. Use an alcohol wipe to disinfect the Lidocaine bottle, then place it onto the
      drape.

6. Non-Sterile Needle and Syringe Opening:
   a. Non-sterile personnel carefully open the needle and syringe packages
      without touching any sterile parts. Let each item fall onto the sterile drape.

7. Sterile Personnel Preparation:
   a. Sterile personnel put on sterile gloves.

Drawing Up the Lidocaine:

8. Handling the Lidocaine Bottle:
   a. The sterile person designated to draw up the Lidocaine should pick up the
      bottle with their non-dominant hand only.

9. Drawing Up Medication:
   a. The same person uses their dominant hand to hold the syringe plunger and
      insert it into the Lidocaine bottle.
   b. With the dominant hand, draw up the required amount of Lidocaine using
      the syringe.

10. Handing Off the Syringe:
    a. Carefully hand the filled syringe to the sterile person responsible for
       attaching needles.

Attaching the Needle and Storing:

11. Needle Attachment:
    a. The person designated for needle attachment takes the syringe and
       secures a needle onto it, then places the assembled syringe with the
       needle into the designated "boat" (container).

12. Labeling:
    a. Write the date and your initials on a sticker, then apply it to the Lidocaine
       bottle before placing it in the boat.

13. Final Step – Storage:
    a. Place the boat containing the prepared syringe(s) into the fridge for
       storage until use.

Following these steps ensures sterile preparation of the Lidocaine for subconjunctival
injections, maintaining safety and minimizing infection risk.

6. Review
• This will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to ensure continued
compliance and efficiency.
