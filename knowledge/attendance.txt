ATTENDANCE AND ABSENCES

Unscheduled absences will be monitored, and excessive occurrences may require a healthcare provider’s statement.

UNEXCUSED ABSENCES:
RETINA ASSOCIATES allows employees up to five (5) days of Unexcused Absence per year, beginning from the date of hire. These are for time off not covered by PTO or Holiday policies.
