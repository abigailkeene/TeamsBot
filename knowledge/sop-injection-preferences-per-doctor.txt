1. PURPOSE

Injections are administered to treat various retinal conditions that, if left unmanaged, could lead to vision loss. These injections deliver medication directly into the eye to effectively target retinal conditions.

Injections are quick and minimally invasive and help preserve and, in some cases, improve vision over time. At Retina Associates, the goal of each injection is to support the health and function of patients' eyes and maintain their quality of life.

This structured guide ensures effective assistance during the injection process while accommodating each doctor’s specific preferences.
