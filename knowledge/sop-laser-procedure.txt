1. Purpose
At Retina Associates, laser treatments serve several purposes in managing retinal and other eye conditions. Some of the primary uses include treatment of diabetic retinopathy, managing retinal tears or detachments, treatment of AMD (age-related macular degeneration), reduction of macular edema, and secondary cataract (posterior capsular opacification). Laser treatments are generally quick, minimally invasive, and effective in managing various eye conditions, helping patients maintain or improve their vision over time.

This SOP outlines the responsibilities and procedures for Clinical Technicians, including patient preparation, diagnostic testing, assistance during procedures, and equipment maintenance. It ensures standardized, high-quality support in clinical operations to enhance patient care and support the medical team in providing effective retina treatments.

MDI: Electronic Health Record  
OCT: Optical Coherence Tomography  
HPI: History of Present Illness  
VA: Visual Acuity  
IOP: Intraocular Pressure  
LBS: Low Blood Sugar  

4. Responsibilities
Clinical Technician: One should be able to consistently perform all assigned duties within the recommended time frame and in accordance with clinic protocols within 6 months of employment.
