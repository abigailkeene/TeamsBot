PAID TIME OFF (PTO)

ELIGIBILITY:
PTO begins accruing on the date of hire for all employees who are regularly scheduled to work. Temporary and as-needed employees are not eligible to accrue PTO.

PTO accrues based on a 40-hour workweek (2,080 hours annually), excluding overtime. Part-time employees accrue PTO on a prorated basis (e.g., 20-hour workweek = 50% accrual, 30-hour workweek = 75%).

• PTO does not accrue during unpaid leave.
• Higher accrual rates take effect the first pay period after an employee’s anniversary date.
• Employees may carry over up to 80 hours of PTO annually; excess PTO is paid out in the last paycheck of the current year.
• PTO is available after 30 days of employment, with further accruals requiring approval for use.
• Unused PTO is paid out upon termination as long as 2 week notice has been given.

PTO USAGE & REQUESTS:
• Employees must use accrued PTO for time off, with requests submitted at least two weeks in advance via Paychex Flex.
• PTO approval is based on staffing needs and office procedures. Unscheduled absences will be monitored, and excessive occurrences may require a healthcare provider’s statement.
• Requests are processed on a first-come, first-served basis, considering existing approvals and physician schedules.
• Employees must secure PTO approval before committing themselves to extended leave.
• PTO cannot be borrowed against future accruals. In rare cases, advance leave may be granted. Any excess PTO used before departure will be deducted from the final paycheck.
