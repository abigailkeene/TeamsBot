1. Purpose
Sterile Betadine (povidone-iodine) preparation is used as an antiseptic solution to prevent infections before surgeries or invasive procedures. Its key purposes are for antiseptic action, pre-procedure preparation, and wound care. Betadine's effectiveness in killing microbes while being relatively gentle on the skin makes it an essential part of the surgical and clinical aseptic protocol.

2. Scope
This SOP outlines the responsibilities and procedures for Clinical Technicians, including patient preparation, diagnostic testing, assistance during procedures, and equipment maintenance. It ensures standardized, high-quality support in clinical operations to enhance patient care and support the medical team in providing effective retina treatments.

3. Responsibilities
• Clinical Technician: One should be able to consistently perform all assigned duties within the recommended time frame and in accordance with clinic protocols within 6 months of employment.

4.1 Checklist of Supplies for Betadine Preparation

To set up a sterile Betadine application for surgical or procedural use, you will need the following supplies:

1. Sterile Gloves  
Required to maintain aseptic technique and prevent contamination during the setup and application of Betadine.

2. Sterile Drape  
A sterile covering used to create a clean field and isolate the application site from non-sterile surfaces.

3. Betadine Bottle  
A sterile povidone-iodine solution for disinfection. Ensure it is within the expiration date.

4. Dropper Bottle Kit  
A sterile, controlled dispenser attachment that allows for the precise application of Betadine without contaminating the solution.

5. Mask  
Provides protection against droplet contamination, ensuring a clean environment while handling sterile materials.

6. Expiration Stickers  
Used to clearly label the Betadine bottle with its expiration date, ensuring it remains safe and effective for use.

7. Surgical Tape  
Useful for securing the drape or other sterile items as needed during preparation.

4.2 Betadine Preparation and Storage Procedure

1. Prepare Workspace with Sterile Drape  
Open the drape package and lay it across your workspace to create a sterile field.

2. Set Up Drop Bottle Kit  
Open the package containing the drop bottle kit, placing it on the sterile drape within reach.

3. Put on Sterile Gloves  
Open the sterile gloves package and put them on to maintain aseptic technique.

4. Disassemble Drop Bottles  
On the drape, carefully disassemble each drop bottle to prepare for filling.

5. Transfer Betadine Solution  
Squeeze the Betadine bottle to fill each drop bottle approximately 2/3 full.  
Continue transferring until the Betadine bottle is completely empty and all drop bottles are filled.

6. Reassemble Drop Bottles  
Securely reassemble each drop bottle to ensure it is tightly sealed.

7. Label Drop Bottles with Expiration Date  
Write the expiration date (7 days from today) on the desired number of labels.  
Affix an expiration date sticker to each drop bottle.

8. Secure Labels with Surgical Tape  
Place a piece of surgical tape over each expiration sticker to prevent smudging or peeling.

9. Refrigerate Drop Bottles  
Place the labeled Betadine drop bottles in the refrigerator for storage, ensuring they will remain sterile and ready for use within the labeled expiration period.

This systematic process ensures Betadine solution is prepared, labeled, and stored properly, preserving sterility and effectiveness.

5. Review
This will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary to ensure continued compliance and efficiency.
