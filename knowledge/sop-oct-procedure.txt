1. Purpose
The purpose of the OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) procedure is to provide detailed imaging of the retina’s layers, enabling doctors to detect, monitor, and manage various eye conditions, such as macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma. OCT allows for non-invasive, cross-sectional imaging, giving precise insights into retinal thickness and structural abnormalities. This helps in early diagnosis, tracking disease progression, and evaluating the effectiveness of treatments, ultimately supporting better patient outcomes and personalized care.

2. Scope
This SOP outlines the responsibilities and procedures for Clinical Technicians, including patient preparation, diagnostic testing, assistance during procedures, and equipment maintenance. It ensures standardized, high-quality support in clinical operations to enhance patient care and support the medical team in providing effective retina treatments.
